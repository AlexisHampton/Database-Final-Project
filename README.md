# Database-Final-Project
The final for my Database Systems class.
In it, one can submit a problem to be solved, commit SQL to solve a problem and run the SQL query
The ip and user and pass have all been removed, so it will not work unless those fields are filled in. 
Also, it was built to access a specific database I used for my class, and the queries in the SQLQuery class will reflect that
